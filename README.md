Project overview

The goal of this project was to create a schedule for a typical work day. The goal was for the app to display the current time and day and then a series of time blocks for 
each hour of the work day 9am to 5pm. I am used to using a 24 hour clock and saw some instances where it might make this assignment easier so I opted for 9:00 to 17:00. The 
app is supposed to allow for some one to enter tasks into each of the time blocks and save those tasks so they could reference them later. The text was also supposed to stay in place even if the page is refreshed. Also as the time of the day progressed the color of the text blocks was supposed to change based on if the event was in the past present or future.

HTML

I used bootstrap grid system and the classes provided in the css document to create 9 different rows. Each with their own save button input field for text and element that shows which hour it is. It was also important that that I added unique id's to the seperate save buttons and input fields so that I could differentiate between them
